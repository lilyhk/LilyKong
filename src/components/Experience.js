      Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in corporate retail for a few well known Bay Area retailers, most recently Gap Inc., managing sales plans for departments upwards of $150m in retail sales. I have experience working cross-functionally with merchants, marketing, and production teams to develop buy-strategies and promo plans, and pitching these plans to directors and VPs on a weekly basis. My work had its own exciting challenges but I knew I wanted to tackle something new and different. I also know that my skills gained over the years, both soft and analytical, will not go to waste.
