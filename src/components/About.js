      <h1>Hello</h1>
      <p>
      My name is Lily and I am a software engineer based in San Francisco, CA. I am proficient in Javascript and have experience working with RESTful APIs, Nodejs, Reactjs, etc. I most recently worked for Galvanize as a Software Engineering Immersive Resident providing technical guidance to current students working towards their own goals of becoming successful engineers.

      What drew me towards engineering is the creative aspect of it all and how the field is constantly advancing. In my personal life, I have explored many creative outlets from drawing to ceramics to leather working. Creating software felt like a new and exciting medium to take on where there are endless approaches and there is always something to improve upon.
