      My name is Lily and I am a software engineer based in San Francisco, CA. I am proficient in Javascript and have experience working with RESTful APIs, Nodejs, Reactjs, etc. I am currently working for Galvanize as a Software Engineering Immersive Resident providing technical guidance to current students working towards their own goals of becoming successful engineers.

      Before becoming a software engineer, I worked in corporate retail for a few well known Bay Area retailers, most recently Gap Inc., managing sales plans for departments upwards of $150m in retail sales. I have experience working cross-functionally with merchants, marketing, and production teams to develop buy-strategies and promo plans, and pitching these plans to directors and VPs on a weekly basis. My work had its own exciting challenges but I knew I wanted to tackle something new and different. I also know that my skills gained over the years, both soft and analytical, will not go to waste.

      What drew me towards engineering is the creative aspect of it all and how the field is constantly advancing. In my personal life, I have explored many creative outlets from drawing to ceramics to leather working. Creating software felt like a new and exciting medium to take on where there are endless approaches and there is always something to improve upon.
